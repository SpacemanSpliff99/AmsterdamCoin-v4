<p>PUFFScoin is a cutting edge cryptocurrency, with many features not available in most other cryptocurrenciesn and backed by real-world utility through the Leafy Cauldron Apothecary, a medical cannabis dispensary in Nova Scotia , Canada. PUFFS may also be accepted in other dispensaries down the road, but at launch, we will maintain the currency as both a distributed crypto-asset as well as a proprietary transaction processing and customer database for the retail dispensary. Featuring simple Proof of Stake rewards, coupled with a competitive Masternode provision service, PUFFScoin will function with many added features, such as:</p>
<p>Anonymized transactions using coin mixing technology called <em>Obfuscation</em>.</p>
<p>Fast transactions featuring guaranteed zero confirmation transactions, called <em>SwiftTX</em>.</p>
<p>Microtransaction processing for PUFFS-branded smart phone games with in-app purchases denominated in PUFFS</p>
<p>Decentralized blockchain voting providing for consensus derviced development towards the current Masternode technology used to secure the network and provide the above features, each Masternode is secured with collateral of 5000 PUFFS</p>
