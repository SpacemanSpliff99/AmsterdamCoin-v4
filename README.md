    <p> We will have a very limited POW phase with low rewards beyond the Genesis Block fund. We will be using this period to ensure masternodes are operating efficiently, transaction obfuscation and instant send functions are operating, and so on.</p>
    <p> You can view our Genesis Sale schedule, including our purchase agenda for each phase and the escrowed checkpoints we will satisfy along the way, along with the PUFFScoin Genesis Sale terms and conditions at www.puffscoin.com/genesis.html.</p>

<p><strong><span style="color: #800080;"><em>PoS Block Reward:</em></span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>[block# 10081-Infinite] Fluctuates based on SeeSaw Reward Mechanism (Masternode:stakeholder saturation based) and a specific Block Reward schedule during the first two years of blockchain operation based on the Mandelbrot Curve. This reward structure will ensure that the protocol will initiate the minting of PUFFScoin to a balance essentially equal to the simple staking Cauldron and Developer Reserves. Our goal is to reach equilibrium between MasterNode ownership and simple stakeholding wallets to create a 20%:15% APR respectively. Our hope is that this coin generation agenda will encourage early MasterNode investment while ROI turnaround is very rapid, and maintain this sort of investment opportunity over the first two years of operation when the network reward levels off to 20 PUFFS/block.</li>

<ul>
<li>[block# 1] 100,000,000 PUFFS Premine to create Cauldron active-transaction wallet for dispensary (50 mln), Genesis Sale funds (5 mln, 50% scheduled for the Sale and 50% set aside if demand from community demands it, otherwise these funds will be set towards bounties and social media campaigns following the Genesis Sale), 4 equal-weight developers reserves (10 mln each), as well as an Early Bounties Fund (2.5 mln) and a Masternode builders wallet and contingencies (2.5 mln). We will be giving away several Masternodes in our first few months of blockchain operation, as well as constructing a minimum of 10 Masternodes (50,000 PUFFS) administered by the Leafy Cauldron Apothercary, with profits going into the Veterans Endowment Fund. </li>

<p>PUFFScoin is a cutting edge cryptocurrency, with many features not available in most other cryptocurrenciesn and backed by real-world utility through the Leafy Cauldron Apothecary, a medical cannabis dispensary in Nova Scotia , Canada. PUFFS may also be accepted in other dispensaries down the road, but at launch, we will maintain the currency as both a distributed crypto-asset as well as a proprietary transaction processing and customer database for the retail dispensary. Featuring simple Proof of Stake rewards, coupled with a competitive Masternode provision service, PUFFScoin will function with many added features, such as:</p>
<p>Anonymized transactions using coin mixing technology called <em>Obfuscation</em>.</p>
<p>Fast transactions featuring guaranteed zero confirmation transactions, called <em>SwiftTX</em>.</p>
<p>Microtransaction processing for PUFFS-branded smart phone games with in-app purchases denominated in PUFFS</p>
<p>Decentralized blockchain voting providing for consensus derviced development towards the current Masternode technology used to secure the network and provide the above features, each Masternode is secured with collateral of 5000 PUFFS</p>
